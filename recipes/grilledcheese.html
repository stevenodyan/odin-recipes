<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8 slices white sandwich bread</li>
    <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons softened butter, or as needed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of butter onto 1 side of each slice of bread.</li>
    <li>Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly smaller than the sandwich sealer, press out round slices of cheese. Lay 4 slices of bread on a work surface, buttered side down. Place a cheese round in the center of each slice. Top with remaining 4 bread slices, buttered side up.</li>
    <li>Center a sandwich sealer over a sandwich, press the sealer down, and hold it in place to seal the edges, 15 to 30 seconds. Pull the crusts away from the sealer; discard. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.</li>
    <li>Place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for 2 hours before transferring into a freezer bag.</li>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). Cook frozen sandwiches until golden, about 5 minutes. If sandwiches are thawed, cook 3 minutes at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C).</li>
