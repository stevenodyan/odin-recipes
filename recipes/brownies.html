<h3>What is this dish?</h3>
<p>This easy brownie recipe takes about 30 minutes to make from start to finish for a chocolaty treat!</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sugar: These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
    <li>Butter: Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
    <li>Eggs: Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder: Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!</li>
    <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
    <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise.</li>
    <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
    <li>Walnuts: Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
